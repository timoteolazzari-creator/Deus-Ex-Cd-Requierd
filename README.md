# Deus-Ex-CD-Requierd
a fix for the cd requeriment for those who download a Deus Ex copy from Internet Archive 
-
First, we are going to open or Cd copy of Deus Ex with a virtual drive program (any will do) and we are going to see the name

.

In my case the name is "E:"

Now we are going to go to the folder where you installed Deus Ex and open the folder "System"

.

Search for "DeusEx.ini" and open it

.

Search for "CdPath" in the engine section, change the letter with the name of your Virtual CD (in my case "E:")

Open the game and the problem should be a goner

If you want to the game no ask for the CD, you should put ..\ in "CdPath" (DO THIS AFTER SEEING THAT THE GAME OPENS)
